# Stocks Analysis AI Agents

This Streamlit app leverages three AI agents to fetch, analyze, and visualize stock market data. It offers an interactive dashboard for quick insights and comprehensive analysis.

## Overview

Users can enter a company name or ticker symbol to receive:
- **Current Stock Price** and key metrics (e.g., forward P/E ratio, recommendations)
- An interactive **candlestick chart** displaying 1-year historical data
- A brief **company overview** if available

The application combines financial data retrieval with web search to deliver a well-rounded analysis.

## AI Agents

- **Web Search Agent:**  
  Uses tools like GoogleSearch and DuckDuckGo to gather additional market context and news.

- **Financial AI Agent:**  
  Utilizes yfinance (via YFinanceTools) to fetch detailed financial metrics and historical stock data.

- **Stock Market Agent:**  
  Integrates the capabilities of both the Web Search and Financial agents to generate a holistic stock analysis.
